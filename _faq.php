              <p class="faq-text text">
                The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, particularly the eyes, nose, or mouth.

              <p class="faq-text text">
                The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days after exposure, with an average of around 5 days. During this time, an infected person may not show symptoms but can still spread the virus to others, making asymptomatic transmission a concern.

              <p class="faq-text text">
                The best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include wearing masks in public settings, practicing physical distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from others, washing hands frequently with soap and water, using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, avoiding large gatherings, and staying home when feeling unwell.
